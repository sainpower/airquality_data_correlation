# University of East London (UEL) – Air Quality Data Correlation Project

This repository contains work completed as part of a UEL module focused on analysing open-source air quality data. The aim is to extract, transform, and statistically analyse the data to identify correlations between key pollutants.

## Data Sources

The primary data sources for this project are:

1: Air Quality England (AQE)
2: London Air (LA)

These datasets provide hourly readings for various pollutants collected from multiple monitoring stations.

## Key Pollutants

PM2.5

PM10

NO

NO₂

NOxNO₂

## Technology & Methodology

The analysis is conducted using R, with each script including detailed guidance notes that walk through every stage of the data analysis process, from data preparation to statistical correlation.
